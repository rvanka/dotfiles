This is a cache of dotfiles that I use on a daily basis. I use these on a Debian machine in a TCSH shell. Some of the dot files have flags to ensure that their colorschemes work with screen and konsole. 

I love customizing vim - hence the huge dot file for it.
Prior to using the vimrc, you need to install Vundle using the instructions provided here: https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim
